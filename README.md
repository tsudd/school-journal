## Humble instruction how to launch the project on your machine
1. You defeniatly need database backup. You can ask [me](https://github.com/tsudd) to get it or restore database by yourself (good luck!)
2. After that change connection string in App.config file. In fact, you should change only name of data source. (Maybe we should make config system for easier project set up?)
3. I guess you good to go.
